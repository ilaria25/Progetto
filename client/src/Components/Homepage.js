              Manga and anime are perhaps Japan's biggest cultural export and
              they make up <br></br> one of the most recognizable art styles on
              the planet.
              <br></br> Since the nineties, when everyone in the western world
              <br></br> was suddenly talking about Pok√©mon, Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh!,
              and Dragon Ball Z, <br></br> anime has become something of a
              household term. Something completely associated with Japan{" "}
              <br></br>
              and something that has become one of the biggest cultural trends
              among children and young adults ever since. <br></br> Yet, the
              world of Japanese anime is a lot more varied and complex than we
              in the west might realize. <br></br> 'Anime' only in the west
              refers to Japanese animation as a whole. <br></br> In Japanese
              culture, anime is actually a term for any mass-produced animation,
              Japanese or non-Japanese. <br></br> More, importantly, in Japan,
              anime is not just culture for kids. <br></br> Rather, anime series
              like Naruto or Attack on Titan were all hugely successful amongst
              adults too.
              <br></br> Indeed, many of these series were actually intended for
              adults developing complex themes and plotlines <br></br> and
              presenting three-dimensional and realistic characters.
              <br></br>
              This is the beauty of anime. It can range from the shoujo anime
              shows such as the 'magical girl' series <br></br> like Cardcaptor
              Sakura to the poetic and haunting anime movies like Spirited Away
              and Princess Mononoke.
